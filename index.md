## Welcome to My School Portfolio!

Hello, my name is Huy! Welcome to my page and portfolio! I am a student at Conestoga College and I have been asked to create a page displaying the work I have done. The work consists of past projects that Iâ€™ve created over previous semesters.

### Skills

As a first year student I have already been trained and taught in many applications and code editors.

- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio 2022
- Microsoft Access
- Notepad++
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Xtensio
- JustInMind

### Projects

Utilizing JustInMind I was asked to create a phone game application.  All games must have the same theme regarding story but the students could choose the style of game they would create.  These images display some of the functions and option you could choose in the main menu.  We were also asked to create a web design on a desktop. I designed my website for deleting  viruses.  From visually creating chat boxes to fading backgrounds to coming up with ideas for the application... we did it all.  UX was definitely one of my favourite classes.

In 'Web Foundations' we were asked to create a website bases on your interests for the final assignment.  Using HTML and CSS in Notepad++ I have a created a website on my love for sneakers and tried to emphasis the culture and versatility of sneakers.
